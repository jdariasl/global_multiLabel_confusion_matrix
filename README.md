# Global multi-label confusion matrix

Tipically in multi-label ML problems the evaluation is performed using one binary confusion matrix per class, being difficult to have a view of the system's global performance. This is a purpose for the estimation of a global multi-label confusion matrix, which is normalized to show precision on the main diagonal.
