# Global multiLabel confusion matrix

Tipically in multi-label ML problems the evaluation is performed using one binary confusion matrix per class, so it is diffuclt to see the global performance of the system. This is a purpose for the estimation of a global multiLabel confusion matrix, which is normalized to show precision on the main diagonal.
